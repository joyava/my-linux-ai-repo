        HP Proliant Gen8 Server, 136G RAM, 2x2560v2 Xeons
        
        I saw a comment on YouTube that show another setup can run 70B model
        He was able to run Deepseek R1 70B on old HP Proliant Gen8 server, no GPU
        136G RAM, an 2x2560V2 xeons.

        Asus ROG Flow GZ301, 128 GB RAM laptop 
        
        I am looking for a laptop with 128GB RAM to run LLM locally on CPU only
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1isxhoy/new_laptops_with_amd_chips_have_128_gb_unified/" target="_blank">Visit this Reddit Thread</a>
        It is a new Asus ROG Flow GZ302, 128GB RAM ($2800)
        Someone on Reddit mentioned that LLM model can't use the GPU on this laptop. 
        LLM runs on CUDA which requires Nvidia card.
        But I am fine with Ollama LLM run on CPU with 128GB of RAM
        But it is a bit sad that LLM is not using this 96G VRAM

        $200 Dell PowerEdge R630 96 GB RAM 28 Core Xeon can run 70B LLM on CPU and RAM locally
        
        I asked ChatGPT how long will it take to run a 20-token-query?
        96GB RAM might be too low unless the model is quantized (e.g., GGUF format, 4-bit/5-bit)
        Without quantization, a 70B model may require 200GB+ RAM
        If you manage to load a 4-bit quantized 70B model (like LLaMA 2 70B GGUF 4-bit):
        Cold Start (Loading the model): 5–15 minutes (swapping might make it worse).
        If you manage to load a 4-bit quantized 70B model on your Dell PowerEdge R630 
        (96GB RAM, 28-core Xeon, no GPU), 
        Here's an estimate for a 20-token query:
        For 20 tokens, the CPU might take 100–400 seconds (1.5–6.5 minutes)
        This sever will take about 400 Watt per hour of energy
        (My laptop uses about 450 watt per day like 10 hours)
        I will unplug as soon as Ollama finish giving the answer. 
        For 15 minutes of use, it should cost about 100 Watt. 
        (imo, this dell server could serve as a space heater during winter)
        
        Dual Boot SteamOS and Ubuntu (kind off)
        
        I have mentioned that I kinda damaged my Steam Deck's TPM
        Windows will not be running on this device any more because of TPM
        I have also mentioned that I was unable to dual boot
        Now, I kinda can dual boot
        If I reboot from Ubuntu, 
            I get to that rEFInd menu
            I can choose Ubuntu again
            I don't need to hold down vol button and power button
        If I reboot from Steam OS, 
            I don't see that rEFInd menu
            I need to hold down the vol up button and power button
            Reboot from SteamOS is still problematic
        I changed from /EFI/Fedora to /EFI/Ubuntu
        Here is what I did to  /esp/efi/refind/refind.conf

        DIY $2000 PC Running Deepseek AI
        
        This guy built this PC to run Deepseek AI locally.
        Usually only big guys like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft have money to run big AI.
        Now, even an average Joe with $2000 PC can run 671B AI locally (compatible with the real ChatGPT).

        Bricking Steam Deck's TPM With rEFInd Installation
        
        I don't want to use my Steam Deck's desktop mode any more because my mouse cursor is constantly freezing. 
        It annoys me so much. So I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon OS along side of SteamOS.
        I followed this video instruction and almost brick my Steam Deck.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/zEpcBWX9K_o?si=XRPUbJhnGVN1BetV/" target="_blank">Visit this video</a>
        Because it is not working, I tried to force Windows Manager out of BootManager.
        Upon reboot, this SCARY message pop up:
        "fTPM data error. 
        Select [No] to keep fTPM data and continue boot or
        Select [Yes] to reset fTPM. 
        If BitLocker or encryption is enabled, the system will not boot without a recovery key.
        Yes or No"
        Warning: don't click YES because you will brick your Steam Deck.
        By default Windows 11 automatically sets Bitlocker and encryption enable. 
        Solution: boot to bios. In Menu/Advance/Peripheral, I disable fTPM (firmware TPM). 
        When I rebooted, it did not show that scary error message again. 
        But, from now on, Windows 11 can never be installed on this device because of no TPM.

        How to make Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop look like Windows XP?
        
        Step 1: you drop a themed Windows-XP folder into ~/.theme
        Step 2: you drop a Windows-XP-Cinnamon-Icon folder into ~/.icon
        That is it. You are done. You now have a Window-XP desktop.
        Click on the links below to download those 2 folders

        Why not using this Debian with Trinity Desktop that mimic Windows XP?
        I feel that Debian does not have all the softwares installed like Ubunt/Mint
        I would rather use Linux Mint and install a quick Windows XP theme
        This way I have less trouble with installing apps like Ollama and Obsidian

        What is my impression of Linux Mint Cinnamon?
        
        I love it. It has all the features that Linux Mint XFCE does not have.
        For example, it has screen saver and night light.
        On this Cinnamon desktop, my mouse is not freezing any more.

        Comparing performance: Steam Deck vs Laptop 
        I installed Linux Mint and Ollama on my Steam Deck and laptop with i5 CPU.
        I query Ollama AI with the exact same question on both devices.
        Both devices gave me the answer right away. 
        It means that the Steam Deck has the same performance as my laptop.
        But, the temperature on i5 laptop is 37'C and on Steam Deck is 47'C.

        Can this $180 mini PC perform better than a Steam Deck?
        <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/eat-this-raspberry-pi-5-here-are-3-powerful-amd-ryzen-mini-pcs-that-sell-for-under-usd180-and-trounce-expensive-sbcs" target="_blank">Bosgame mini pc spec</a>
        Obviously, mini pc should run faster than a Raspberry Pi 5.
        I think the answer is "NO" base on Google search.
        
        Here are some comparisons from Google search:
        
        Comparing Steam Deck to Bosgame Mini PC
        
        Bosgame PC has Ryzen 5 3550H CPU, dual HDMI, usb-c(1080p), 512GB, 16GB, $180
        Steam Deck has APU 0405 Zen 2, usb-c, 512GB, 16GB, $300
        
        Steam Deck
        Cinebench multithreaded (CPU power) - 4436
        Cinebench single thread (CPU power) - 977
        3Dmark Firestrike (GPU power) - 4856

        Ryzen 3500u (equivalent to Bosgame mini pc)
        Cinebench multithreaded (CPU power) - 3544
        Cinebench single thread (CPU power) - 876
        3Dmark Firestrike (GPU power) - 2559

        Compare my laptop (intel-i5-1035G1) to Mini PC (Ryzen-5-3550H)
         Google shows Mini PC Ryzen-5 WIN
         Reddit shows Laptop i5-1035  WIN
         IMO, Steam Deck is faster than MiniPC (Ryzen-5)
         IMO, Laptop (i5-1035) is faster than MiniPC (Ryzen-5)
         IMO, Steam Deck and Laptop-i5-1035 have the same performance
        
         From Google: Ryzen 5 is faster (twice the speed, better graphic)
         From Reddit: Yeah the i5 9300H beats the R5 3550H by over 15% in overall speed/performance. 
         So R5 3550H would be like i5 7300HQ 
         So the i5 9300H would be like a R5 4500U. 
         Even if you got the R7 3750H, it'd still be weaker than the i5 9300H (on par with i7 7700HQ) 
         But you'd have to pay more because retailers assume all R7 chips competes with i7. 
         I typically see 
         1. Ryzen 3 beat Core i3 and rival i5 U and G-Series on laptops
         2. Ryzen 5 rival i7 U, G, and H-Series.

        2. The next button is for blocking blue light
        3. The next button is a joystick (idk how to use it)

        Some Raspberry Pi can be overclock to 3GHz
        But, my RPI5 is unable to boot to 2900Mhz
        My RPI5 is stable at 2700Mhz and 2800Mhz.
        RPI5 is much faster than RPI4.
        But, I still hate the sluggishness.

        <p>Blue light blocking issue
    <pre><code>
        OMG, my eyes are hurting so bad with this monitor.
        I am about to return this monitor, but I give it one more try.
        There is a button that look like a tiny joystick.
        Instead of moving North, South, East, West, I pushed up.
        Suddenly a menu appeared. There are 3 or 4 modes.
        In each mode, I changed the brightness to 0% and blue-light-blocking to maximum.
        It seems to work pretty good. My eyes are not hurting any more.
        Guess what. I plugged in my Chromebook's output to the second HDMI input.
        Suddenly, I have a giant e-ink screen to read whatever I want. WOW.

        With dual monitors, my mouse cursor is very sluggish.
        Google and YouTube did not yield any solution
        I give up on SteamOS as my daily driver.
        Maybe Linux Mint can run dual monitors smoothly.
