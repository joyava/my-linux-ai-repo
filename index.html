        Sep 2, 2025: How to install Windows-apps on Linux OS?
        Traditionally: you can install windows apps via Wine or Proton
        Now: WinBoat is a new way to install Windows apps on Linux OS
        <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-is-my-new-favorite-way-to-run-windows-apps-on-my-linux-pc-how-it-works/" target="_blank">Visit this guy's video</a>

        Q: what is the difference GPT4All and Newelle?
        A: GPT4All is a GUI application for Ollama.
        Instead of querry Ollama in a terminal, I can querry Ollama in a beautiful GUI
        Example: after upload a heart failure file, I ask GPT4All "what are some symptoms of CHF?"
        On the other hand, Newelle is a little bit different
        Newelle is also a GUI application for a Linux OS using Ollama brain.
        I am querry newelle about file management.
        Example: do I have this ADME file in my computer?
        What is my computer's temperature?
        

        x x  x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x 
        Problem: Ollama installation error

        curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
        ollama --version
        Warning: could not connect to a running Ollama instance
        Warning: client version is 0.6.1
        joy@linux:~$ ollama list
        Error: could not connect to ollama app, is it running?
        
        Answer: type: ollama serve

        Problem: Error on Gemma3:27B AI model

        ollama run hf.co/unsloth/gemma-3-27b-it-GGUF:Q4_K_M
        Error: POST predict: Post "http://127.0.0.1:39643/completion": EOF

        Answer: you need more than 36GB of RAM
        This Error is misleading. It has nothing to do with webpage interface.
        You need more RAM because 36GB RAM in my PC is not enough.
        I can't add more RAM to my PC. So I use a smaller model (12b)
        ollama run gemma3:12b-it-q4_K_M
        This quantize version runs in most PC
        36GB of RAM is successfull for gemma3:12b-it-q4_K_M

        Problem: I Bricked my Steam Deck because of installing Dual Boot
        
        I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon OS along side of SteamOS.
        I followed this video instruction and almost brick my Steam Deck.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/zEpcBWX9K_o?si=XRPUbJhnGVN1BetV/" target="_blank">Visit this video</a>
        Because installation failed, I tried to force Windows Manager out of BootManager.
        Upon reboot, this SCARY message pop up: "fTPM data error. 
        Select [No] to keep fTPM data and continue boot or
        Select [Yes] to reset fTPM. 
        If BitLocker or encryption is enabled, the system will not boot without a recovery key.
        Yes or No"
        Warning: don't click YES because you will brick your Steam Deck.
        By default Windows 11 automatically sets Bitlocker and encryption enable. 
        
        My answer: boot to bios. In Menu/Advance/Peripheral, I disable fTPM (firmware TPM). 
        When I rebooted, it did not show that scary error message again. 
        But, from now on, Windows 11 can never be installed on this device because of no TPM.

        Update: imo, if I replace the current ssd with the original ssd,
        I should get back to the original state with no scary message pop up!
        So, keep your original SSD in a safe place just in case you need it

        How to make Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop look like Windows XP?
        
        Step 1: you drop a themed Windows-XP folder into ~/.theme
        Step 2: you drop a Windows-XP-Cinnamon-Icon folder into ~/.icon
        That is it. You are done. You now have a Window-XP desktop.

        Why not using this Debian with Trinity Desktop that mimic Windows XP?
        I feel that Debian does not have all the softwares installed like Ubunt/Mint
        I would rather use Linux Mint and install a quick Windows XP theme
        This way I have less trouble with installing apps like Ollama and Obsidian

        Asus ROG Flow GZ301, 128 GB RAM laptop 
        I am looking for a laptop with 128GB RAM to run LLM locally on CPU only

        It is a new Asus ROG Flow GZ302, 128GB RAM ($2800)
        Someone on Reddit mentioned that LLM model can't use the GPU on this laptop. 
        LLM runs on CUDA which requires Nvidia card.
        But I am fine with Ollama LLM run on CPU with 128GB of RAM without GPU
        But it is a bit sad that LLM is not using this 96G VRAM (from GPU)

        News: Cheapest way to run 70B model locally using Dell R630 server ($200)
        
        Dell PowerEdge R630 96 GB RAM, 28 Core Xeon, can run 70B LLM on CPU without GPU
        I asked ChatGPT how long will it take to run a 20-token-query?
        96GB RAM might be too low unless the model is quantized (e.g., GGUF format, 4-bit/5-bit)
        Without quantization, a 70B model may require 200GB+ RAM
        If you manage to load a 4-bit quantized 70B model (like LLaMA 2 70B GGUF 4-bit):
        Cold Start (Loading the model): 5–15 minutes (swapping might make it worse).
        If you manage to load a 4-bit quantized 70B model on your Dell PowerEdge R630 
        (96GB RAM, 28-core Xeon, no GPU), 
        Here's an estimate for a 20-token query:
        For 20 tokens, the CPU might take 100–400 seconds (1.5–6.5 minutes)
        This sever will take about 400 Watt per hour of energy
        (My laptop uses about 450 watt per day like 10 hours)
        I will unplug as soon as Ollama finish giving the answer. 
        For 15 minutes of use, it should cost about 100 Watt. 
        (imo, this dell server could serve as a space heater during winter)

        RPI5 is much faster than RPI4.

    <pre><code>
        OMG, my eyes are hurting so bad with this monitor.
        I am about to return this monitor, but I give it one more try.
        There is a button that look like a tiny joystick.
        Instead of moving North, South, East, West, I pushed up.
        Suddenly a menu appeared. There are 3 or 4 modes.
        In each mode, I changed the brightness to 0% and blue-light-blocking to maximum.
        It seems to work pretty good. My eyes are not hurting any more.
        Guess what. I plugged in my Chromebook's output to the second HDMI input.
        Suddenly, I have a giant e-ink screen to read whatever I want. WOW.

        My mouse cursor is very sluggish.
        Google and YouTube did not yield any solution
        Answer: instead of connecting mouse-adaptor directly into the Anker-dock,
        I connect the mouse-adaptor to a long usb cable which connect to the Anker-dock
        Problem solved. (maybe interference problem)

        <h2>Cheapest way to run full Deepseek:671B using 1.1T swap partition</h2>
        <p>Run a Full-size Deepseek:671B-r1 on consumer hardware, EXTREMELY slowly!
    <pre><code>
        
The basic steps are:
Install a 2tb SSD
Install Ubuntu with over 1TB of swap
Install Ollama
Use Ollama to run Deepseek r1 671b

This computer's approximate specs:
AMD Ryzen 7 5700
16gb generic ram
No gpu, just whatever is built in on the Ryzen
2tb WD_Black SN770 NVMe SSD

The results:
About 50 seconds per token, 0.02token/second
About 15mins from prompt to first output token
Full response took overnight

Things to note:
SSDs have finite write lifespan
This output used ~6TB of the lifetime 1200TB of writes, 
meaning we used up about 0.5% of the hard drive's total lifespan creating a single response
It is probably faster/cheaper to use the cloud if you want cheap outputs
You can have a ton of fun with the smaller 7b model
Model 7b is small enough to run in ram.

        <p>Answer: I want to install a copilot-clone (Newelle) for GNOME desktop environment
    <pre><code>
        Step 1: I pick this Pop!_OS because it uses GNOME desktop
        Step 2: I want to try Newelle AI, and it requires GNOME desktop
        Step 3: Here are the apps I installed on this computer
        3a. chrome browser via Pop!_shop
        3b. newelle ai app via Pop!_shop
        3c. localsend app via Pop!_shop
        3d. obsidian app via Pop!_shop
        3e. ollama app via: curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
        3f. Msty.ai app via appimage
        3g. GPT4ALL via website download
        After all this work, Newelle is not really work. 
        It has no problem answer querry like ChatGPT
        But, it did not response to querry regarding the file system like make a ADME folder in home directory
        I think it is working, but certain configuration is required for file management. I am sad.
        It did give me a correct answer if I ask what is the current time.

        I replaced Pop!_OS with Ubuntu with GNOME desktop environment
        It seems to run faster
