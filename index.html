        <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Ubuntu Linux</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that involves the development of intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Ubuntu Linux, on the other hand, is a popular open-source operating system based on the Debian distribution of Linux.</p>

        <h2>Why use Ubuntu Linux for AI?</h2>
        <p>Ubuntu Linux is a preferred choice for AI development and deployment for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Ubuntu is open-source, which means its source code is freely available, allowing developers to modify and customize it according to their needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Ubuntu has a large and active community of developers and users who provide support, contribute to development, and share knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Stability and Security:</strong> Ubuntu is known for its stability and security, making it a reliable platform for AI development and deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Ubuntu is compatible with a wide range of AI frameworks, libraries, and tools, making it easy to set up and use for AI development.</li>
            <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Ubuntu supports containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, which are essential for deploying AI applications in production environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started with AI on Ubuntu Linux</h2>
        <p>My journey begin here:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Google chrome browser. Download .deb file. cd to ~/Downloads then dpkg -i google-chromesomthing.deb </li>
            <li>Once Ubuntu is installed, update the system and install essential development tools using the terminal:</li>
            <pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential</code></pre>
            <li>I want to keep a backup copy of my work in another computer.</li>
            <li>So, I install syncthing app</li>
            <pre><code>sudo apt install syncthing
sudo systemctl enable syncthing@joyava.service
sudo systemctl start syncthing@joyava.service
sudo systemctl status syncthing@joyava.service 
on your browser type http://localhost:8384
Click setting, click GUI tab, Enter your username and password. Click save. 
repeat these steps on another ubuntu laptop2
Get ID from Ubuntu laptop1 and Enter that ID into Ubuntu laptop2 
How do you do that? Click action, click show ID, copy to google keep this ID 
On Ubuntu laptop2:
Copy ID code from google keep
click "add remote device" at the bottom of the page
You paste ID code into this pop up window. click save

On Ubuntu laptop1:
click "add device" on pop up message
change device name to "laptop2". click save.
Now you sit back and watch the "remote device" box
When it shows "connected", you are done
type ls on your terminal
you should see a Sync folder along with Downloads and Pictures folder
The default Sync folder is at ~/Sync
The "default folder" entry on your browser shows /home/username/Sync
click "edit" button, it popup a windows with 3 tabs
click sharing tab, then tick the box
click file_version tab, choose "simple file version. click save.

On laptop2:
click share button

Certain questions I don't want to chat with ChatGPT because of privacy
I want to chat with an ai locally on my old computer (ideapad3 i5-CPU)

Installing ollama.ai
sudo apt install curl
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama run phi
ollama run mistral 
x x x  x x x
I don't even know how to make this html webpage.
So, I ask chatGPT to create this index webpage for me 
Here is the query to chatGPT
create a detail html script about ai and Ubuntu linux
x x x  x x  x x
I need somebody to host my website for free.
This YouTuber (Cameron McKenzie) shows me how to create webpage or other files on github server
https://youtu.be/MaqVvXv6zrU?si=L0F8wPT2Z5R-zfWp
So I am using "GitHub Desktop" app to publish this personal webpage for free. 
To summarize this GitHub Desktop, you just put your files into a github folder on your local drive
click commit. </code></pre>
            <li>I tried to install LM Studio, but the installation failed because it needs a modern computer and maybe an Nvidia GPU. So from now on, you don't buy any computer that is on sale because most stores want to dump their pre-ai era computers. So they can restock with ai computers. You just wait for ai computer to come out. If need be, buy a computer with Nvidia GPU and 16 GB of RAM. Most ai models need 16, 32, or 64GB of RAM. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Ubuntu Linux provides a stable, secure, and flexible platform for AI development and deployment. Ubuntu Linux is an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers in the field of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>One more thing. My Raspberry Pi 5 just arrived. I put the RPI5 in a Geekworm case model P573. When I turned it on, the wifi is super weak and unusable. I was about to return it back to canakit.com. Then, I remembered that canakit rep told me that they only sell official raspberry pi products. They don't sell third party accessories. I took the RPI5 out of the fanless metal case, and it works great! But, I put the RPI5 back into the fanless metal case again. I don't screw it tight like the last time. It also works! So maybe the last time, I screwed it too tight, and the metal case exerts pressure on the wifi chip which causes it to malfunction.</p>  
        <p>Please excuse all my grammatical mistakes. I will fix it in the next update. I learn so much from people on the internet and YouTube. I want to contribute back. Just in case other websites or YouTube video disappeared, I still have this webpage to refer back to.
